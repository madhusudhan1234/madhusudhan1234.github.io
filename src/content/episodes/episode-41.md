title: "AI, Open Source, Pay Gaps, and the Future of Software Power"
description: "This week in tech, we explore how power is shifting in software. AI is enabling companies to do knowledge work themselves, accelerating long-standing pressures on labor. Software engineers still hold massive leverage through code, but real influence now comes from business, leadership, and ownership skills. We also unpack why pay gaps in tech are driven by timing and scale—not just merit—and why clear boundaries around open source matter for sustainability. The future of software belongs to those who understand where leverage truly compounds."

### **The Bubble Is Labor: AI as Capital’s Path to Doing the Work Itself**

companies don’t hire people because they want to. They hire people because founders can’t do all the work themselves. If they could—if they had unlimited hands and brains—the ideal number of employees would be zero.
That leads to a scary realization. No one is actually responsible for creating jobs. Jobs exist only because owners need help.
Now enter AI. This isn’t companies “replacing workers.” It’s companies finally being able to do the work themselves. When global knowledge work costs tens of trillions of dollars every year, investing heavily in AI suddenly makes perfect sense.
This reframes everything. AI isn’t breaking a stable system—it’s accelerating an inevitable one. Capital has always tried to reduce its need for labor. AI is just different because it replaces intelligence, not tasks.
It’s unsettling. But maybe it’s not evil—just new physics.

### **The Entrepreneurial Software Engineer’s Path To Business Leadership**

Software engineers create enormous value because code has near-zero marginal cost and massive leverage—one engineer can impact millions of users. That’s why demand and salaries are rising sharply. But to maximize their impact, engineers must go beyond writing code and develop product, business, and leadership skills. Communication, writing, and mentoring help engineers scale their influence through people, not just systems. Understanding business goals, product strategy, and design enables better decisions and greater ownership. Finally, building strong relationships within teams, companies, and the wider industry turns engineers into intrapreneurs—people who create outsized value from within organizations or launch successful ventures of their own.

### **Confronting Career Inequalities: Respect, Timing, and the Pay Gap in Tech**

Is compensation really about merit, or mostly about timing and context? Two leadership paths—a COO underpaid relative to a VP—showing how early entry and organizational timing shape titles, scope, and pay. Respect also diverges: some leaders fight for basic authority while others are granted autonomy, underscoring that job satisfaction depends as much on how work is treated as on role or skill.
The broader point is uncomfortable: tech’s revenue-per-employee dwarfs other industries (Apple’s RPE vs. ~$170K averages), so pay concentrates where output scales. That leaves many high performers elsewhere working longer, harder hours for far less, and fuels imposter syndrome in tech—even among capable leaders who doubt whether their pay reflects true value. The takeaway for managers: acknowledge the structural gap, budget with empathy, and anchor compensation decisions in impact and respect, not just optics or tenure. Owning these realities—timing advantages, organizational politics, and tech’s outsized economics—helps teams navigate fairness with clarity rather than guilt.

### **“Source Available” Isn’t Open Source**

Is “open source” just “source is open”? Dries Buytaert critiques David Heinemeier Hansson’s launch of Fizzy under the O’Saasy license, which blocks competing SaaS and therefore violates the Open Source Initiative (OSI) definition. Matt Mullenweg pushes back, and Dries argues the term has a specific, community-built meaning that shouldn’t be repurposed for marketing. Calling Fizzy “source available” is more accurate: you can read, run, and modify the code, but SaaS rights are reserved.
The deeper issue isn’t semantics—it’s sustainability. Many companies profit from open source while leaving maintenance to others, creating a “free rider” problem that projects like Drupal and WordPress have wrestled with for decades. Dries sees value in experimenting with licenses that discourage customer free-riding, and says O’Saasy fits that mold—but it’s still not open source. The takeaway for developers and leaders: protect the integrity of the OSI definition while tackling sustainability head-on through contribution credits, incentives, or policy. Dries reframes the debate: definitions keep the commons coherent; sustainability keeps it alive.

### **Opinionated Agents Beat “General Purpose” Every Time**

Should agent products offer more knobs or better outcomes? The case for opinionated design: pick a narrow task, do lots of work on the user’s behalf, and encode hard-won team knowledge into prompts, tools, and defaults. The “flexibility trap”—exposing temperature, chunking, and model pickers—pushes complexity onto users. Instead, dogfood relentlessly, evaluate on real tasks (not benchmarks), and prune configuration until the baseline agent works reliably.
The surprising point: models are non‑fungible in their harness. Intelligence is spiky, so a model swap can break tuned prompts and tool use; only the harness+model pair that succeeds on your task matters. The practical playbook is deep and narrow—optimize ruthlessly for the 10% of workflows that drive most value, avoid “wide” agents that try everything and “shallow” agents that shouldn’t be agents at all. Implication for builders: audit configs, hardcode good defaults, and specialize by domain (as seen with Cursor, Claude Code, DeepAgents, Amp Code). Opinionated choices create dependable agents; options can come later once the core experience is solid.
