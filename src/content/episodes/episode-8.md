### **Redis Reborn: Open Source Unleashed and Faster Than Ever!**

Redis is back-truly open source, and bigger than ever! After years of licensing debates, Redis has officially returned to its open source roots under the AGPLv3 license. This isn’t just a legal change-it’s a massive win for developers, the community, and the future of real-time data.
Why does this matter? Redis 8, the first version under the new license, just launched with game-changing features: up to 87% faster commands, double the throughput, and eight new data structures-including the brand-new Vector Sets, designed by Redis’ original creator. These aren’t just technical upgrades-they’re tools that will power the next generation of AI, real-time analytics, and lightning-fast apps.
But the real story? Redis is once again a community-driven project, open for everyone to build, improve, and innovate. This move reaffirms Redis’ commitment to transparency, collaboration, and empowering developers worldwide.
So if you care about open source, performance, and the future of data, now is the time to get involved. Redis is open, Redis is fast, and Redis is ready for what’s next.

### **AI Replacing Engineers – Firsthand Stories?**

There is a thread on the Hacker News "Ask" tab titled “AI Replacing Engineers – Firsthand Stories?” where people are sharing real experiences and the hype from their companies about AI replacing humans. The discussion is buzzing with stories: some engineers say AI tools have made them 2-3 times more effective, helping them grok codebases and automate boilerplate work, while others warn that the real work-understanding problems, designing solutions, and integrating code-remains deeply human.
Many users point out that AI is great for prototyping, documentation, or simple coding tasks, but falls short for mission-critical systems or complex projects. The consensus? AI is shrinking teams, especially for junior roles-one dev said they no longer hire juniors because AI can handle that level of work. But senior engineers, who translate business needs into technical solutions, are still irreplaceable for now.
A sharp observation: the higher up you go in management, the more excitement there is about AI-and the less common sense and real understanding of how developers and large language models actually work. One user summed up the mood with this gut instinct: “There’s going to be an AI crash, much like in the late 90s or early 2000s. Too much hype, and then, after the crash, maybe we’ll start to see something a bit more sane and realistic.”
Bottom line: AI is making teams leaner and more productive, but the real engineering-the thinking, planning, and deep problem-solving-still needs humans at the helm.
