### **Thirteen new MCP servers from Cloudflare you can use today**

how would you like instant, AI-powered access to Cloudflare’s best tools, right from your favorite platforms? Well, get ready, because Cloudflare just dropped thirteen new MCP servers—and they’re game-changers!
Let’s play a lightning round:
* Need up-to-the-minute Cloudflare documentation? There’s a server for that.
* Want to build and debug serverless apps with live data? Covered.
* Curious about global internet traffic or want to fetch and screenshot web pages on the fly? Yup, that too!
And it gets even better:
These servers connect directly to platforms like Claude.ai, Cursor, and Windsurf. Imagine just asking, “Hey, show me the latest DNS analytics,” and boom—real-time insights at your fingertips.
Who’s already on board? Big names like Atlassian, PayPal, and Sentry are building with these tools. Plus, every server is locked down with precise permissions and robust security.
So, here’s your call to action:
If you want to supercharge your workflow with AI, connect your MCP client to Cloudflare’s new servers. The future of app development, security, and performance is here—are you ready to plug in?

### **When to use AI to generate code**

AI coding tools have revolutionized development, but knowing when to use them is key. Before reaching for AI, ask yourself three questions:
Will it actually save you time, considering you’ll still need to review, test, and maintain the code?
Do you trust AI to get the task right, or will you spend more time debugging?
And what’s the risk if something goes wrong—could bugs or security issues slip through?
AI shines at repetitive tasks—think boilerplate code, refactoring, generating tests, writing documentation, and even adding comments. It’s also great for features you already understand well, letting you move faster with clear prompts and quick reviews.
But if you’re tackling something new, use AI to learn and remove uncertainty before generating code. For security-critical or mission-critical features, create a detailed task list, ask AI about best practices, and always get an expert to review the results.
Bottom line: AI can write most of your code, but your judgment, review, and understanding are essential. Use AI to boost productivity, but keep those guard rails up—especially for high-risk code.

### **Senior Devs Admit to Googling Basic Syntax**

In a surprising revelation, senior developers are openly admitting to regularly Googling basic programming syntax and concepts. Jotham Arinze, a DevOps expert, shared his own "senior moments" where he had to look up common AWS CLI commands, Nginx configurations, and Kubernetes port-forwarding.
Arinze argues that the true mark of an experienced developer is not perfect recall, but rather strong problem-solving skills, pattern recognition, and the ability to efficiently find solutions. Rather than viewing Googling as a weakness, senior devs see it as a powerful tool in their arsenal.

### **Kubernetes Workloads & Services — Explained with an Amusement Park Analogy**

In a captivating new article, the FAUN Developer Community takes readers on a whimsical journey through "Kubernetes Park", where the platform's core components are brought to life through clever comparisons.
Pods are likened to individual rides, ReplicaSets act as vigilant supervisors, and Deployments are the savvy park managers. StatefulSets represent personalized attractions, while Jobs and CronJobs are the one-time shows and scheduled events.
This creative approach transforms the complex world of Kubernetes into an easily digestible, visually engaging experience, inspiring developers to find their own unique ways of explaining technical concepts.

### **SFTP vs. FTPS: The Battle of the File Transfer Protocols**

In a data-driven deep dive, the team at SFTP To Go put the age-old debate to the test - which file transfer protocol reigns supreme, SFTP or FTPS? Through rigorous benchmarking across various file sizes, batch counts, and client tools, they uncovered some surprising insights.
The results showed that neither protocol is a clear winner - FTPS excels with fewer, larger files, while SFTP shines in high-volume, small-file scenarios. Crucially, the choice of client also played a major role in protocol performance. So before committing to a file transfer solution, it's essential to test in your real-world environment to find the optimal combination of protocol and tooling.
