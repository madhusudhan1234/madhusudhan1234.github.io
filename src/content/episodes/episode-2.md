The rise of AI coding assistants is causing an identity crisis for software engineers, who are shifting from hands-on builders to orchestrators of AI-generated code. This transition challenges the core satisfaction engineers get from creating solutions and mastering technical skills. For devs to adapt to this change, they should balance deep technical work with strategic AI orchestration.
